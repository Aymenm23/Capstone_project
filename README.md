# Capstone_project
This is my capstone for the duration of the bootcamp at BrainStation.

# Capstone Project Breakdown:

# Title: Harvesting Hope: Revolutionizing Farming Practices for Sustainable Crop Yield Growth

# Objective:

- Use machine-learning and precision agriculture to predict food production and world hunger index of top 10 most impoverished countries.


# Datasets:
- World Hunger Index
- Country Agricultural Land 
- Country Crop Production
- Country Population Statistics
- Vegetation Health Index
- Vegetation Condition Index
- Crop Recommendation Datasets (Which crop suits what kind of environment and production stats)

# Goal: 
Use precision agriculture to assess how production of vegetation in an informed manner can affect the world hunger index and crop yield.
